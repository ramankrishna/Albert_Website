            <p>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist. He developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). Einstein's work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. Einstein is best known in popular culture for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2 (which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation"). He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879. His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current. The family moved to Italy in 1882, first to Milan and then to Pavia. In 1884, the family moved to Aarau, Switzerland, where Einstein's father and uncle established a new electrical engineering company, Einstein & Cie. In 1896, Einstein's father and uncle decided to incorporate their company, which was renamed "Albert Einstein & Cie".</p>

                    <h3 class="desc">The special theory of relativity is the generally accepted physical theory describing the relationship between space and time. It was developed by Albert Einstein between 1905 and 1907, and published in 1905 in his paper "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies".</h3>

                    General Theory of Relativity</a>
                    <h3 class="desc">The general theory of relativity is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and the current description of gravitation in modern physics. The general theory of relativity explains the gravitational force as a consequence of the curvature of spacetime, and this curvature is caused by the presence of mass and energy in the universe.</h3>

                    <h3 class="desc">The photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons or other free carriers when light shines on a material. The effect was first observed in 1887 by German physicist Heinrich Hertz in his experiments with ultraviolet light. The effect was independently rediscovered by Albert Einstein in 1905, and he published a paper on the subject in 1905. The photoelectric effect is one of the most important experiments in the history of physics, and it is the foundation of quantum theory.</h3>

                    <h3 class="desc">Brownian motion is the random motion of particles suspended in a fluid, caused by their collision with the fluid molecules. The term was coined by Robert Brown in 1827. The motion of the particles is caused by the thermal agitation of the fluid, and is therefore called thermal agitation. The motion is also called molecular motion, molecular diffusion, or random walk. The term Brownian motion is also used to describe the random motion of molecules in a gas.</h3>

                    <h3 class="desc">The field equations of general relativity are a set of partial differential equations that describe the geometry of spacetime. They were first published by Albert Einstein in 1915. The field equations are the basis of the theory of general relativity, which describes the gravitational field as a consequence of the curvature of spacetime. The field equations are also the basis of the theory of gravitation in modern physics.</h3>
